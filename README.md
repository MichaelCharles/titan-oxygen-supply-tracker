# Oxygen Supply Tracker for OceanGate Titan Submarine

This was created to keep track of the remaining oxygen supply for the crew of the OceanGate Titan Submarine. On June 18th, 2023, the OceanGate Titan Submarine went missing, and the crew onboard was left with a limited supply of oxygen. The Titan was equipped with a 96-hour oxygen supply. For more information on the situation, you can read this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/us/missing-submarine-titanic-search.html).
